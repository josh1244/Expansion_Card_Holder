# Expansion Card Holder
A tool to store four extra expansion cards for the framework laptop. Designed to work and look the same as the laptop.
Slide your cards into the side of the holder.

I printed using the Dremel Digilab 3D 45 and it came out great. Make sure to print with no supports as they will fill the USB-C holes. The Expansion Cards are held in with friction and they will not fall out.

# Design
I designed this using Inventor 2022 on Windows and have supplied the porject files. I made the project modular so it can support 6 or 4 or however many extra cards you have.
